# py_passwordGen
This is a Password generator programme that generates passwords based on a user input
it generates and reminds you your password

## Description of coding practices
   
   * In this Python project i was tasked to create a password generator application that will generate a random password everytime the code is ran with lenghth of 12 characters. 
   
   * The password should have a mix of lowercase letters and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbol
  
  1. To start of, i had to randomize the generated password whenever we run the apllication. to do so we have to import the random module.
  
  2. To have a combination of lowercase, uppercase letters, numbers and symbols we have to import the string module which we can then access it properties
  
  3. Through the code i used a number of functions like def get_password_lenth(): Which retrieves the lenghth of a password and returns the number <class 'int'> 
  
  * def password_combination_choice():  This function Prompt a user to choose password character combination which 
	 could either be digits, letters, punctuation or combibation of 
	 either of all of them.
