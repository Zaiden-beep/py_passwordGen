# py_passwordGen
This is a Password generator programme that generates passwords based on a user input
it generates and reminds you your password

## Description of coding practices
   
   * In this Python project i was tasked to create a password generator application that will generate a random password of 12 characters length everytime the code ran. 
   
   * The password should have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols
  
  1. To start of, i had to randomize the generated password whenever we run the apllication. To do so we have to import the random module.
  
  2. To have a combination of lowercase, uppercase letters, numbers and symbols we have to import the string module which we can then access it properties. 
  
  3. Throughout the code i used a number of functions like:

  * def get_password_length(): Which retrieves the length of a password and returns the number <class 'int'> 
  
  * def password_combination_choice(): This function Prompt a user to choose password character combination which 
	 could either be digits, letters, punctuation or a combibation of 
	 all of them.
